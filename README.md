Source file from the Google actions lab I did at #AndroidMakers (Paris 2017). All jokes are mine.

Based on https://github.com/Sfeir/actions-on-google/tree/master/templates/simple


Lab was gloriously animated by  Elaine Dias Batista (https://twitter.com/elainedbatista) and Wajdi Ben Rabah (https://github.com/wadjo)

There is of course some stuff to set in the google api console.
